asdf-browser for slime

I took original code by Stanis≈Çaw Halik (sthalik@test123.ltd.pl) from
this c.l.l post
http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.lisp/browse_thread/thread/ce68d8fb9b93c29d
and slightly upgraded it.

Two major features added - autocompletion of package names and ability
to navigate to system definition file.

Completion works for loaded system definitions by default, but by
customizing value of `asdf-browser-show-loaded-systems-only' custom
variable you can make it to complete among all known packages.
