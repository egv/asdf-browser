asdf-browser for slime

I took original code by Stanis≈Çaw Halik (sthalik@test123.ltd.pl) from
this c.l.l post
http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.lisp/browse_thread/thread/ce68d8fb9b93c29d
and slightly upgraded it.

Two major features added - autocompletion of package names and ability
to navigate to system definition file.

Completion works for loaded system definitions by default, but by
customizing value of `asdf-browser-show-loaded-systems-only' custom
variable you can make it to complete among all known packages.



INSTALLATION
==============

Simply clone git repo to somewhere on you disk and add to your .emacs
the following line:

;; suppose you've cloned repo to ~/.emacs.d/asdf-browser
(load-file " ~/.emacs.d/asdf-browser/asdf-browser.el")


For convinience you can bind it to some chord, mine is "C-c
C-a". Binding is done by adding this to .emacs:

(define-key slime-mode-map "\C-c\C-a" 'asdf-browser)



USAGE
======

Mx asdf-browser will prompt for system name in minibuffer. Note, that
if you have cursor standing on some word, it will be put to
minibuffer. 

You can complete names with tab. If
asdf-browser-show-loaded-systems-only is t, completion will be done
only over already loaded system definitions, if it is nil, than
completion is done over all known systems.

Also, if you will browse through some unloaded system it's definition
will become loaded because (asdf:find-system ...) loads it.
